= Boundary Devices BSP

To get the BSP you need to have `repo` installed and use it as:

Install the `repo` utility:

[source,console]
$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

[source,console]
$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
$: mkdir boundary-bsp
$: cd boundary-bsp
$: repo init -u https://github.com/boundarydevices/boundary-bsp-platform -b boundary-imx-5.4.47-2.2.0
$: repo sync

At the end of the commands you have every metadata you need to start work with.

To start a full build for Nitrogen8MP:

[source,console]
$: DISTRO=fsl-imx-xwayland-boundary MACHINE=nitrogen8mp source imx-setup-release.sh -b build
$: bitbake imx-image-full

You can use any directory to host your build.

The source code is checked out at `boundary-bsp/sources`.
